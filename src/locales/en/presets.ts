  vmafMeasureAboutBody:
    "VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion) is an objective video quality metric proposed by Netflix. It estimates how close an encoded video looks compared to a reference.\n\n• Typical range: 0–100. Higher usually means closer to the reference. It is best for comparing presets on the same content (avoid comparing absolute scores across different sources).\n• What “≥95” means: this is a common rule-of-thumb threshold often interpreted as “visually near-lossless / differences are hard to notice”, but it is not a guarantee and still depends on content, display, viewing distance, and noise/grain.\n• How this tool works: it encodes the reference video with the selected preset, then runs ffmpeg's libvmaf filter to compare reference vs encoded output and uses the mean score. Audio is ignored.\n• Content-dependent: the same preset can score differently on different sources, so use a reference video similar to your real workload.\n• Version/model differences: scores can differ across ffmpeg/libvmaf versions or models. Compare results within the same environment.\n• Resolution requirement: VMAF requires both streams to have the same dimensions; the tool aligns/scales internally.\n• Trim seconds: default is first 30 seconds for speed. Increase it if you want a more stable mean.",
